🔍 Overview

PcRHC-IGWO is a scalable, Spark-based metaheuristic attribute reduction method for high-dimensional datasets. It combines:

    A Rough Hypercuboid Model for structured uncertainty modeling

    An Improved Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) with:

        ✨ Pheromone guidance (from ACO)

        🔀 Mutation operations (from GA)

    🧮 Parallel computing on Apache Spark

📊 Designed for distributed environments, it is particularly effective for large-scale data feature selection.
